Hey

Most of the work behind this isn't mine, go check the original source I forked off of to see the stuff for that.
But what I did do was inspired by the ending of this video here: https://youtu.be/FW2Hvs5WaRY?t=240 .
I tried my best to be as accurate as possible but unfortunately I couldn't get everything from the video.

There's also some weird sound bugs that I'm not sure how to solve, mainly just that it doesn't seem to sync up correctly but idk how to fix that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**How to use**

Just press record and start twisting the cube to hear the sounds. Press record again to see all your moves be played back for you.
