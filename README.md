# Group Theory, Pianos, and Cubes


The inspiration for this project came from this clip: https://youtu.be/FW2Hvs5WaRY?t=240 


If you watch the whole video you will come to find that it joins the faces of a rubiks cubes to chords on a piano. The video explains the chord progression from discordance to harmony could be an audible representation of a group theory solution to a mixed Rubik's Cube. Upon hearing of this connection I wanted to ser (or hear) for myself what such a thing would sound like. So I implemented the necessary function to record and play, into Stewart Smith's implementation of a browser based Rubik's cube and created this.


# How to use


Open index.html and click "record" in the bottom left corner. Every twist you make will be played back to you. When record is deselected it will play all your moves in sequence, thus "playing" your solution (if you managed to solve the cube that is).

Only one face will be played at a time, which can be selected via the dropdown menu.

Enjoy!
